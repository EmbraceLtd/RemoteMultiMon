RemoteMultiMon
==============

This application enables multiple monitors in Remote Desktop (Windows).
This could be useful for scenarios where you don't have access to the Remote Desktop UI dialog, for example in certain VPN solutions.

For a better experience, the application should be set as the default application for .rdp files.

Usage
=====
* Build the program (preferably as as a single binary) and put in in a folder of your choice.
* Make it your default application for .rdp files, for instance using Default Apps in Windows' settings.
* You're done.
