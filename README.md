RemoteMultiMon
==============

This application enables multiple monitors in Remote Desktop (Windows) by adding the appropriate settings in the .rdp file.
This could be useful for scenarios where you don't have access to the Remote Desktop UI dialog, for example in certain VPN solutions.

Usage
=====
* Build the program (preferably as as a single binary) and put in in a folder of your choice.
* Make it your default tool for .rdp files, for instance using Default apps in Windows' settings.
* You're done.
